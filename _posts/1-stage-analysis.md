# Stock Stage Cycle Indicator

This indicator helps in the identification of the stage cycle of a stock. It should only be analyzed on Weekly and Daily timeframes.

## Stages

1. **Stage 1**: Accumulation phase of a stock
2. **Stage 2**: Uptrend phase
3. **Stage 3**: Distribution phase
4. **Stage 4**: Downtrend phase

## Understanding the Stages

As shown in the chart, each stock goes through its stage cycle. Below points confirm the uptrend of a stock and provide an idea of when to buy a stock:

- **Stage 1 Completion**: Wait for the first green label up bar to appear. This confirms the completion of Stage 1.
- **Stage 2 Start**: Another green label appears, indicating the start of Stage 2.
- **Stage 2 Uptrend Confirmation**: Finally, a yellow label up appears, confirming the Stage 2 uptrend.
